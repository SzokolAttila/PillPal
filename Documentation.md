# PillPal Documentation

## Summary
Most elderly people faces the difficulties of managing vast variety of medicines, creating the proper schedule for them, keep in mind all the descriptions and not to forget taking them. That's the problem we are aiming to solve or at least provide a tool to make it easier.
Our solution consists of a WebAPI, a Class Library, a MAUI App and a WebApplication. In the following we are going to break them down into smaller segments and introduce their details.

## Class Library
### User
User class consists of Id, Username and Password properties. Our password is a byte array which is generated by hashing the string type password given via constructor. For hashing we're using a unique salt so it gives more security. User class also has a Matches(string password) function for checking if the given password is the same as the user's byte[] password after hashing. We've made 3 constructors: one for logging in, one for JsonConstructor and one for the controller for registering a new user.
### Medicine
Medicine class consists of Id, Name, Description, Manufacturer, PackageUnit, PackageSizes, SideEffects, ActiveIngredients and RemedyForAilments properties. PackageUnit stores the unit of the medicine's PackageSizes which is either "ml" or "mg". PackageSizes, SideEffects, ActiveIngredients and RemedyForAilments are multi-valued fields so they have a separate table and joined together with medicine. Medicine class has 2 constructors: one JsonConstructor with id and one constructor without id. Multi-valued fields are set from outside and not from constructor.
### Reminder
Reminder table is a join-table itself so its class behaves the same way. It has the following properties: Id, UserId, User, MedicineId, Medicine, When, DoseCount, DoseMg, TakingMethod. User and Medicine properties are nullable as they're set from outside based on UserId and MedicineId. DoseCount stores the quantity to take in and TakingMethod stores how to take it in.
